                    <li><strong>Attractiveness:</strong> The general societal perceptions of attractiveness play a role in the score.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feminism:</strong> The level of radical feminism affects the match score negatively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Your preference for climate also influences the score.</li>
                    <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Culture alignment, whether traditional or modern, also impacts your score.</li>
                     <li><strong>Other factors:</strong> Countries that speak a major language and those near yours get boosted. There are also boosts for countries that align with your racial and religious preferences.</li>
